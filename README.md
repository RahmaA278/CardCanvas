#### ‚úíÔ∏èüìÉ Elevate your study game with bespoke flashcards and notes

A personalized study application where you can effortlessly craft your own flashcards and notes, all with a line-paper aesthetic. You can curate and revise your bespoke study material with ease.

### Reason for this project?
While many note-taking apps exist, none quite capture the nostalgic essence of pen meeting paper. This project leverages CSS to recreated the familiar line-paper aesthetic, giving users the comforting feel of traditional notebooks in a digital format. The goal is to provide a seamless transition from offline to online note-taking, allowing users to effortlessly embrace the convenience of digital tools without sacrificing the familiar touch of pen and paper.

Expanding on the previous project, I wanted to focus on user authentication using vanilla JavaScript. I also wanted to add more pages and complexity to enhance the overall experience.
